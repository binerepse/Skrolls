**Authors: Bine Repše, Nejc Sušin, Adrijan Šlutej**

A *Skroll* is like a public Twitter/Tumbler profile. 
Anyone can post text, images, videos or links.
New posts are added to the bottom of the stack, creating a never-ending scroll of images/text...
Skrolls can be accessed directly via URL (e.g. www.skrolls.com/nejcwishlist) or they can be browsed/searched for via the index of all public Skrolls.
A visitor can register an account by providing his e-mail and choosing a password. Username is optional.
